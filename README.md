# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This project entailed reviewing vectors, hash tables, and binary trees, and performing an algorithm analysis to dertermine which would serve as the most efficient data structure to store data from a file.
My initial analysis selected the binary tree, but after attempting to implement that structure, I found that the hash table made more sense for the data I was working with.
I ultimately decided to use the unordered_map function to automate the hash function and store the class ids, titles, and prerequisites.
The program loads the data into the unordered_map, displays each course, and allows the user to search for a course.
Working on this problem allowed me to uderstand why data structueres are important in software development. Different structures have certain advantages over others depending on the type of data that is involved.
